ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie

I am a the compiler team manager at Oxford Quantum Circuits, with a background in quantum information theory. 

My work focuses on quantum compilers and runtimes. In particular, error mitgiation, quantum error correction and hybrid quantum execution.

I also work in techincal partnerships, if you think we can build something cool together or want to work with OQC, get in touch.
