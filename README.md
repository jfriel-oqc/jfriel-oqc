ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie

I am a the Technology Manager: Quantum Theory at Oxford Quantum Circuits, with a background in quantum information theory. 

My work focuses on quantum error correction and assorted other interesting quantum theory questions.

I also work in techincal partnerships, if you think we can build something cool together or want to work with OQC, get in touch.
